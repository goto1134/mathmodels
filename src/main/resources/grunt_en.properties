theory_part_1=Supply of large cities and industrial centers with clean water for drinking and water for technological needs has become acute techno-environmental problem.  To solve it, in addition to opened and therefore easily contaminated sources (rivers, lakes, reservoirs) water-containing groundwater reservoirs are widely used. They are less prone to anthropogenic influences, but issues related to the often inevitable pollution for them remain relevant. This model allows us to consider the dependence of the concentration of impurities in the water at certain characteristics of the source of contamination, hydrological barrier and at different time intervals.rnOn the coordinate axes are three graphs: red determines the flow of water from the source of contamination, purple determines the flow of water from the barrier, and green - the resulting concentration of impurities in the water.
theory_part_2=The figure shows a top view of the reservoir. Crosses denote inflate well, squares - water wells, and asterisks - the source of pollution.
